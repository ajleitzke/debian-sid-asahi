09:10 < j`ey> Glanzmann: `git rev-list 6f59bc24287..smc/work` that might work, not sure how it deals with merges. git rebase is the better way. but if you do that youre on your own!
09:19 < _jannau_> Glanzmann: git rebase --onto 5.17-rc3 6f59bc24287
09:23 < j`ey> if you add -p it can also preserve the merges

19:13 < j`ey> but there's also CONFIG_OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT, which makes of_dma_is_coherent always return true

21:02 < jannau> mps: you need https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20220208210215.8612-1-j@jannau.net/ for extlinux

ARCH: 23:29 < ah-[m]> yep, exactly. I had to grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and move my Image.gz to /boot, otherwise it was just what was on the wiki page

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20211011165707.138157-1-marcan@marcan.st/
19:02 < jannau> I think based on this branch https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/tree/cpufreq/v1

23:41 < kov> Glanzmann, hmm interesting, I'll try upgrading libinput firs then, see if that fixes it
23:42 < kov> it's weird because I remember the trackpad working a while ago
23:45 -!- mtjzh (~mtjzh@2a02:8388:1742:9b80:658f:93d3:ec68:d60e) has joined #asahi
23:46 < kov> yep, just upgrading to testing's libinput makes it work heh thanks Glanzmann!

10:10 < jannau> see the commit message for 64k on ppc64 https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/445c099c6486b8e5ff8dafaefcd812a7ea4bdfff%5E%21/

15:26 < tpw_rules> last i checked the built chromium only worked with the flags --in-process-gpu --no-sandbox --no-zygote but that may have been a kernel config problem
