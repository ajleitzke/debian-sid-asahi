09:10 < j`ey> Glanzmann: `git rev-list 6f59bc24287..smc/work` that might work, not sure how it deals with merges. git rebase is the better way. but if you do that youre on your own!
09:19 < _jannau_> Glanzmann: git rebase --onto 5.17-rc3 6f59bc24287
09:23 < j`ey> if you add -p it can also preserve the merges

19:13 < j`ey> but there's also CONFIG_OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT, which makes of_dma_is_coherent always return true

21:02 < jannau> mps: you need https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20220208210215.8612-1-j@jannau.net/ for extlinux

ARCH: 23:29 < ah-[m]> yep, exactly. I had to grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and move my Image.gz to /boot, otherwise it was just what was on the wiki page

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20211011165707.138157-1-marcan@marcan.st/
19:02 < jannau> I think based on this branch https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/tree/cpufreq/v1

23:41 < kov> Glanzmann, hmm interesting, I'll try upgrading libinput firs then, see if that fixes it
23:42 < kov> it's weird because I remember the trackpad working a while ago
23:45 -!- mtjzh (~mtjzh@2a02:8388:1742:9b80:658f:93d3:ec68:d60e) has joined #asahi
23:46 < kov> yep, just upgrading to testing's libinput makes it work heh thanks Glanzmann!

Chromium 16KB patch: https://tg.st/u/Set-kernal-page-size-to-16K-on-loongson-MIPS-archtec.patch
10:10 < jannau> see the commit message for 64k on ppc64 https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/445c099c6486b8e5ff8dafaefcd812a7ea4bdfff%5E%21/
15:26 < tpw_rules> Glanzmann: https://pastebin.com/NzJEQJDW - https://tg.st/u/NzJEQJDW
15:26 < tpw_rules> last i checked the built chromium only worked with the flags --in-process-gpu --no-sandbox --no-zygote but that may have been a kernel config problem
Upstream BUG: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236564

22:39 < jannau> `dtc -I fs -O dts -o - /proc/device-tree` will output the device-tree as seen by linux

19:11 < Glanzmann> axboe: Could you explain how to mark a device as write-through? Does that mean if I issue a sync in Linux that no flush will happen. Because this would be helpful for the m1 notebook owners to improve performance.
19:11 < axboe> I just do: `echo "write through" > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/write_cache"` for now...
19:11 < axboe> Glanzmann: ^^
19:12 < axboe> Glanzmann: and yes, that's what it means
19:12 < Glanzmann> axboe: Thanks.
19:12 < axboe> Glanzmann: it'll bump your test case from 56 iops to 14k or something like that :)
19:12 < axboe> alternatively, some sort of time based hack might make sense
19:13 < axboe> "only issue flush if X seconds has passed since last issue"
19:13 < axboe> kinda nasty, but safer

15:50 < mps> axboe: Glanzmann: `libinput Disable While Typing Enabled (268):    1` is set in my case and it works fine
15:51 < mps> though I built latest beta of libinput and rebuilt xf86-input-libinput with it
15:52 < mps> i.e. libinput-1.19.901
15:52 < axboe> mps: promising
15:53 < mps> but still didn't got it to detect thumb
16:07 < mps> Glanzmann: `libinput quirks list /dev/input/event1` will show you features of input device
16:09 < mps> and `libinput quirks list /dev/input/event1` will show quirks from libinput database

From mps:
#!/bin/sh
echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
echo 1 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_fn_leftctrl
echo 1 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_opt_cmd

19:19 < Glanzmann> sven: Do you know why axboe set the admin queue to 2 instead of 8?
19:19 < sven> yes
19:19 < sven> almost all commands go through the io queue, no need to waste that space for the admin queue

# j`ey on deleting efi and Linux partitions from the gui in macos
20:46 < j`ey> Glanzmann: I didnt figure it out at the diskutil cli, but I managed to do it from the GUI, I think you have to erase/reformat as APFS before you can delete the volumes
10:53 < j`ey> Glanzmann: for your notes: < tpw_rules> you can delete a non-apfs partition with: diskutil eraseVolume free n disk0sX
21:07 < tpw_rules> you can delete a non-apfs partition with: diskutil eraseVolume free n disk0sX

08:54 < mixi> Glanzmann: the command you're looking for should be "dtc -I dtb -O dts /sys/firmware/fdt"
08:57 < jannau> Glanzmann: dtc -I fs -O dts -o - /proc/device-tree

# j`ey on hack to hookup lid close/open
23:19 < j`ey> apple_smc_event_received in drivers/platform/apple/smc_core.c is a good place to start looking

# kettenis on the same issue using existing infrastructure
23:20 < kettenis> so the lid is hooked up to gP01
23:24 < kettenis> looks like you could try hooking that up using gpio-keys-polled
23:27 < Glanzmann> kettenis: So gpio-keys-polled would poll gP01 and send a key event and than I could use my window manager to do something when that key event is received?
23:29 < kettenis> look at arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q-novena.dts

# How to subscribe to smc events
23:45 < j`ey> Glanzmann: if youre still interested in looking: drivers/power/supply/macsmc_power.c apple_smc_register_notifier(power->smc, &power->nb);
23:46 < j`ey> so this driver gets called, when an SMC notification happens. looks like all registered handlers would be called and its up to the callback to figure out if it needs to do something

# More background
23:54 < kettenis> if the interrupts are hooked up correctly for thise SMC gpios, gpio-keys instead of gpio-keys-polled should work
23:54 < j`ey> no irq_chip in the current driver

17:34 <marcan> the image as built will have a real grub config with static UUIDs
17:35 <marcan> well, a systemd early unit but yes

07:54 < VinDuv> So I’ve been looking at how macOS installation from USB works on M1 Macs and I think it might be interesting for the Asashi installer. The way it works is that there’s a hidden plist file on the USB drive that references a macOS
                application on the drive; if this file is present, the USB drive will show up in the power-button-held boot menu, and when selected, it will run the application. It doesn’t seem to care about file signature
07:54 < VinDuv> (it works even if the app is just a shell script) and it looks like it’s in 1TR mode.
07:56 < VinDuv> So the installation workflow from 1TR could be “plug in a USB stick, hold the power button, select Install Asahi” instead of having to manually open the terminal and run curl | sh. The installer doesn’t even need to be graphical since
                it’s possible for the launched shell script to start the recovery environment’s Terminal and giving it an arbitrary command to run.
07:59 < VinDuv> This is also not limited to external USB drives; it also works if the files are in an APFS volume in internal storage, which I guess might be useful to have a Asahi Recovery boot option in the boot menu or something.

19:14 <VinDuv> marcan: I have done a bit more testing with the .IAPhysicalMedia file and it looks like ProductBuildVersion can be any value including blank. ProductVersion seems to be checked against the minimal macOS version supported by the Mac; on my mini the icon shows up in the boot menu only if it’s >= 11.3.
19:15 <VinDuv> Maybe it should be set to a higher value for forward compatibility with future Macs that will require 13.0? I’ve tested setting it to 99 and it works.

21:46 < povik> with pulse, you can get the jack by getting into pacmd
21:46 < povik> and running: load-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,1
21:56 < povik> that mode of playing in parallel through the speakers and jack has a defect
21:57 < povik> there's noise mixed-in then, at a period
21:57 < povik> don't know how that happens yet

If you see this in Xorg.0.log, it means that simpledrm has not initialized.

An initialized simpledrm looks like that:

This is probably because someone forgot to enable one of the following kernel options:

CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_GPIO=m
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_SIMPLEDRM=y
CONFIG_FB_EFI=n

I deleted partition 4 and 3, run the asahi installer again.

Than I booted debian from the live stick and mounted the root filesystem and the efi file system:

mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p4 /mnt/boot/efi

Than I bindmounted the rest of it:

mount -t sysfs none /mnt/sys
mount -t efivarfs none /mnt/sys/firmware/efi/efivars
mount -t proc none /mnt/proc
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts

Than I changerooted into it:

cd /mnt
chroot . bin/bash

blkid
# Than I updated /etc/fstab with the new id of the efi partition

curl -sLo /boot/efi/m1n1/boot.bin tg.st/u/u-boot.bin

grub-install --removable /boot/efi

exit, umounted everything and rebooted.

12:41 < chadmed> https://gist.github.com/chadmed/2c772c8fdac8280cb17846388203a213 <- some notes on the speaker system in the j314s, and an asound.conf that makes them sound... okay-ish for now

## BEGIN NOTES ##

# HOUSEKEEPING
# All testing conducted with channels set to 40% in alsamixer,
# with no amp gain.

# Do NOT try to play sound with the speakers set to 100% in alsamixer,
# you will fry the cones!

# DRIVER MAPPINGS/ALSA QUIRKS
# The speaker array as set up by the ASoC driver maps like
# this on a J314s:
# 0: Left Woofer 1
# 1: Right Woofer 1
# 2: Left Tweeter
# 3: Right Tweeter
# 4: Left (Sub)Woofer 2
# 5: Right (Sub)Woofer 2

# ALSA sets up the speaker array on the J314s as a 4.0 surround system,
# with the RL and RR channels duplicated across the woofers like this:
# 2: Front Left
# 3: Front Right
# 0: Rear Left
# 1: Rear Right
# 4: Rear Left
# 5: Rear Right

# Obviously this is not correct, but for us it does not matter, since
# we can just tell ALSA to route FL and FR to all drivers, presenting
# it to the rest of userspace as a stereo device. Surround sources
# are downmixed appropriately.

# SOUND CHECK
# Testing reveals that drivers 4 and 5 are likely
# only there to help with bass and sub bass. They
# are extremely bad at reproducing frequencies above
# ~500Hz, and even with the help of the tweeters sound
# rough/deep fried in the mids. Drivers 0 and 1 are obviously
# intended to be the main woofers in the array.

# If we weren't intending to mimic whatever macOS does, my ear-only
# testing would have me setting up a xover network like this:

# Freq Range (Hz) | Drivers
# 0-300 | 0 1 4 5
# 300-6500 | 0 1
# 6500-20000 | 2 3

# Figures based on typical {LP,BP,HP}F rolloff characteristics.

# Using all 4 woofers below 300Hz moves more air than just using the
# (sub)woofers alone. 3-way loudspeakers work like this conventionally.

# The ttable in the j314s-array pcm device tries to compensate for the lack of
# EQ right now by greatly reducing the volume of 4 and 5, and slightly reducing
# the volume of 0 and 1 relative to 2 and 3. I have found this gives an acceptably
# clear sound without being too bright or losing too much out of the mids. Bass is
# nonexistent, though I suspect this is just because we have not applied appropriate
# correction to overcome the machine's housing yet. I will not be applying EQ or filtering
# in ALSA using plugins even in the interim because
# a) it's deprecated
# b) it introduces overhead and chews up CPU time

# FIRs can be applied to a 6 channel slave PCM which would then feed the routing table
# PCM configured below with all coefficients set to 1

## END NOTES ##

# Create a six channel slave for the audio array
pcm_slave.outputs {
    pcm "hw:0,0"
    channels 6
}


# We need to map L and R to the correct drivers. We can use
# the coefficients in ttable to roughly tune the sound profile.
